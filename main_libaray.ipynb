    "# Facial Recognition Attendance System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains the implementation of a facial recognition-based attendance system using OpenCV, face_recognition, and Firebase. The system identifies students in real-time video feed, marks their attendance, and displays relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The attendance system works through the following stages:\n",
    "1. Capture video feed from the camera\n",
    "2. Detect faces in the video feed\n",
    "3. Match detected faces against a database of known faces\n",
    "4. When a match is found, mark the student's attendance in Firebase\n",
    "5. Display appropriate feedback through different UI modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each component of the system."
